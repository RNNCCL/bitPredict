This app analyzes bitcoin history and predicts the behavior of 
bitcoins to help you make better decisions about buying, selling or waiting.
In special cases, the algorithm tells you to wait so that you can sell at a 
higher price or buy at a lower price based on your intention. If you press
"FREEZE" in that special case, you will be prompted to buy/sell whenever it's 
best suited, provided the app remains open and you stay at the Predict page.

To get the correct prediction, please refresh the data as soon as you open
the app. This will take at most 40 seconds. You will not need to refresh the 
data again unless you close the app. The data automatically gets updated.
The "View Charts" button lets you view the variation of the bitcoin over the 
past one year or six months or three months.
Under the "Personalize" section, you can enter your Purchase History and see the
app plot your purchase history on a graph, along with the Resistance and Support
Lines (See algorithm for details).
